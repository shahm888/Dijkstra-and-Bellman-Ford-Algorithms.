Convert Maze into tree and find the shortest path using Dijkstra and Bellman Ford Algorithms.


This project contains following:

 - Convert the Maze into a tree
 - Find the shortest path using Dijkstra algorithm.
 - Find th shortest path using Bellman Ford algorithm.

# Dijkstra Algorithm:

• Dijkstra’s algorithm solves the single-source shortest-paths problem on a directed weighted graph G = (V, E), where all the edges are non-negative (i.e., w(u, v) ≥ 0 for each edge (u, v) Є E).

 # Bellman Ford Algorithm:

• This algorithm solves the single source shortest path problem of a directed graph G = (V, E) in which the edge weights may be negative.
